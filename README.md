# Demographic-Suicide-Analysis
This project started with the paradox of “Suicide in happy places”. 
The economists ‘explanation for this paradox was that people tended to compare themselves to those around them—
if you’re an unhappy person in a happy place, your negative feelings might be exacerbated by your positive surroundings, 
which could lead to suicide’ The other key aspects of this report is to use high level packages available in R
to build visualizations of suicide rates globally and explaining the thought process went behind in generating
a suitable visualization.
